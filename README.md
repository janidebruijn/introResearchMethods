# Politeness in online communication

### Abstract
Nowadays it is very easy to say whatever you want to on the internet, it became more easy by the years.
But did this also lead to a change in our way of speaking online? It definitely did.
am going to look at the change in the usage of politeness by people in online communication.

### Background information
I've gathered two researches on politeness strategies and markers in online communication.
They look at how to recognize politeness, how is it expressed and what words/phrases are mostly used.

1. Pratama, Hendi. Linguistic politeness in online communication. pemimpinmuda. id, 2019.

2. HARWOOD, Chris. "Politeness and university student online communication." Journal of the Faculty of Foreign Studies, Aichi Prefectural University: Language and Literature 49 (2017): 35-45.

### Research question and hypothesis
RQ: How does the use of politeness in online communication change from 2010 until the present?

H: There is a decline in the use of politeness going from 2010 towards the present.

### Method
With a corpus of tweets from the University of Groningen, I am going through an amount of random tweets per year, going from 2010 to 2023.
In these tweets, I'll look for certain politeness markers discussed in the background researches.
If a tweet contains such a marker, it will be marked as polite. This will create ratio's of polite tweets and non-polite tweets per year.
By comparing these ratio's, I hope to find a relationship between years and the usage of politeness.
