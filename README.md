# Politeness in online communication

### Abstract
This study aimed to investigate the trend of politeness in online communication from 2013 to 2022. A program was developed to extract tweets from the University of Groningen corpus and analyze the use of politeness markers. The results showed that there was no significant decline in the use of politeness over the years.

### Background information
The study by Burnette and Calude (2022) analyzed the use of politeness markers in Twitter posts related to Covid-19 in New Zealand, finding that directives were commonly used with politeness markers to mitigate potential impoliteness. 
Graham and Hardaker (2017) provided an overview of (im)politeness in digital communication and highlighted factors contributing to politeness, such as power dynamics, context, and social norms. 
Both studies influenced the methodology of the current research, with Burnette and Calude's findings used to search for politeness in tweets, and Graham and Hardaker's work emphasizing the importance of examining context to determine whether tweets with politeness markers are indeed intended as polite. The current study also builds upon these findings by examining the presence of rudeness markers in tweets marked as polite to verify their intended meaning.

### Research question and hypothesis
RQ: How has the use of politeness changed in online communication in a range of 10 years, going from 2013 to 2022?

H: There is a decline in the use of politeness going from 2013 to 2022.

### Method
I will use a corpus from the University of Groningen to go through all tweets and look for politeness markers. If a tweet contains such a marker, it will be marked as polite. This will create ratios of polite tweets per year. By comparing these ratios, I hope to find a relationship between years and the usage of politeness.

### Usage of code
The code used to replicate this study is available in this repository. The program generates file paths from the Twitter corpus of the University of Groningen. To run the program, simply execute it from the terminal in any directory that contains the program (not in a subdirectory), without any additional command-line arguments. The program will output the results to both the terminal and a file named output.txt.
